Status
------

12/05/16 - status of this project is stasis.
all this code is finished, tested and the project is no longer under development.
project-breakfast-ts2 has all the same functionality, the entire API, ported to Typescript2.
project-breakfast-ts2 is going to be released later today. sometime in the evening.

12/05/16 PM.  - unfortunately today's scheduled release of project-breakfast-ts2 got derailed by Anger Management Meeting. Hopefully there will be some time to address this in the next few days. We are still in a holding pattern until the Angular 2 CLI team releases a beta that isn't broken. Currently, b22.1 is tested and verified as broken and completely and utterly unusable.
